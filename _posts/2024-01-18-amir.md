## About AMIR
AMIR 740 is a highly capable 5-degree-of-freedom mobile manipulator, crafted for seamless integration with wheeled robot platforms or standalone operation. Featuring a *2kg payload capacity* and a *740mm reach*, this robotic arm delivers exceptional dexterity and power for diverse applications. The AMIR 740 leverages the robust Robot Operating System (ROS) for intuitive control and programming, empowering user flexibility and customization.

> The acronym **AMIR** stands for **A**luminum **M**anipulator that's **I**nteractive for **R**over, reflecting its robust construction and collaborative design. Notably, "*Amir*" is also a common male name in my home country of Malaysia, carrying connotations of leadership, nobility, and strength â€“ qualities embodied in the AMIR 740's advanced capabilities.


## My responsibilities

From concept to market, I spearheaded the AMIR 740 project, guiding a cross-functional team of 4 (hardware, manufacturing, sales, and support) through each stage to ensure a triumphant launch. As the technical architect, I meticulously defined requirements, crafted the robot's C++ code, and built an Arduino library for user-friendly access on the ESP32 chip.

My commitment to seamless user adoption extended to developing ROS 1 and ROS 2 packages, simplifying integration and workflows. To ensure precise multi-axis motion, I implemented PID control algorithms, achieving an impressive 97% accuracy. Not only did I conquer the technical landscape, but I also donned the director's hat, planning, editing, and producing a captivating product video that resonated with our target audience.

Beyond the screen, I documented comprehensive technical manuals and provided expert support to users, fostering a smooth transition and building a positive brand experience.

This project is a testament to my ability to:

- Lead and collaborate effectively within diverse teams.
- Craft robust technical solutions, from architecture to code.
- Simplify complex technologies for user-friendliness.
- Captivate audiences with compelling multimedia content.
- Provide expert technical support and foster user satisfaction.

The AMIR 740 is more than just a robotics feat; it's a showcase of my dedication to innovation, collaboration, and exceeding expectations.


## Challenged and Solutions

#### Embracing Learning Curves and Driving Performance:

Developing the AMIR 740 presented exciting challenges that spurred personal growth and innovative solutions. As this project represented my first venture into embedded systems programming and the Robot Operating System (ROS), I embraced the opportunity to independently master these complex technologies under tight deadlines. This self-directed learning instilled valuable skills in adaptability, problem-solving, and resilience, qualities crucial for any career success.

#### Boosting Sales through Value-Driven Innovation:

Driven by a desire to maximize market impact, I identified opportunities to expand the AMIR 740's functionalities and enhance its sales potential. Through careful analysis and market research, I proposed and implemented additional features that broadened the robot's appeal and resonated with new customer segments. This proactive approach resulted in a 20% increase in sales, demonstrating my ability to translate technical expertise into tangible business results.

#### Streamlining Operations for Efficiency:

Keenly observing the production process, I pinpointed a bottleneck in the manufacturing pipeline. To address this, I conceptualized and developed a user-friendly tool for firmware flashing and simplified testing. This innovative solution, depicted in the accompanying image, significantly reduced production time and streamlined workflow, contributing to 39% in overall efficiency.
