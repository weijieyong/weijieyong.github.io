# 1. Motivation behind the creation
It all began with a talk with my girlfriend. She mentioned that some of her coworkers were using a [HHKB keyboard](https://happyhackingkb.com/jp/) over their MacBook Pro's built-in keyboard. 
She was intrigued by the unique typing experience and satisfying sound it offered. However, when she discovered the high cost of the HHKB ([Â¥33500+tax](https://www.pfu.ricoh.com/direct/hhkb/detail_pd-kb820ysc.html) = 36 hours of work![^1] ), she decided to reconsider her purchase decision. 
This got me thinking, why spend a so much on a fancy keyboard when I can create one for my girlfriend that's just as cool and satisfying to use? 
And so, my frugal spirit led me on a journey to discover the world of custom keyboards and find a way to make one that's just as good, but with a more economical price tag.

# 2. Development Process
## 2.1. Researching
I gone down the rabbit hole into the world of mechanical keyboard customization and learned a lot about about what's so fascinating about it. During this time, my YouTube recommendations were filled with videos about keyboards.

Here's my simple and 6-year-old-friendly explaination for each components.
1. **Case**: The part holding everything together, you can think of it like a box to keep your toys.
2. **Keycaps**: The part your finger press, usually made out of plastic like your toy cars.
3. **Keyswitches**: It's basically switches with a spring inside, similar to the light switch in your home, but they stay off until you press them.
4. **Mounting Plate**: This helps keep the keys (switches and keycaps) properly aligned and provides a more solid typing experience. Some keyboard don't have it.
5. **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**: This is the part of the keyboard where the switch is connected and transforms your pressing motion into an electrical signal that the computer recognizes as a key press. The keyboard doesn't measure the strength of your key presses, so there's no need to hit them hard when typing.
6. **Stabilizers**: For longer keys like the spacebar and shift, these are necessary to keep them from wobbling. No one wants to type on keys that feel like a seesaw.

Please note that the above list includes only the most fundamental components of creating a keyboard. There are many other elements to consider, such as adding *dampening foam* underneath the PCB inside the case to minimize noise and vibrations from typing, or *lubing* the switches to reduce friction for a more satisfying experience. (yes, you read that right..)


## 2.2. Defining Specifications & Requirements
After gaining an understanding of the components that make up a keyboard, I began to discuss with my customer (my girlfriend) to determine their minimum requirements for a keyboard.
Fortunately, her requirements for a keyboard are minimal as long as it is compatible with her MacBook Pro and performs well. The following are the specific requirements we have outlined:
- Bluetooth capabilities
- Works with MacOS (because she's using MacOS)
- Linear switches
- Able to fit onto Macbook keyboard
- 3D printed housing (because I can design and manufacture it with my 3D printer)
- A lot cheaper than HHKB!

## 2.3. Conceptualization and Design
Once I have a clear idea of the specific requirements I need the keyboard to achieve, I can begin the process of conceptualizing and designing the product. Where the creative process begins.
To make the keyboard usable over her Macbook Pro keyboard, I opted for a tenkeyless form factor with a 65% layout. This layout features arrow keys, which are frequently used, while eliminating the rarely used fn row.

For the microcontroller, I chose the budget-friendly ESP32, as it offers Bluetooth capabilities and I am familiar with it. In terms of PCB, I decided to hand-solder the components to keep costs low. However, this decision turned out to be a mistake (more on that later).
