## Why did I start this blog? 
### 1. Organize thoughts and learn at the same time
I realized that a significant portion of my free time goes to aimlessly browsing through YouTube videos without gaining anything substantial. Most of the time, I consume the content without retaining anything valuable. I aspire to utilize my time more effectively. Writing can serve as a means to think critically, organize my ideas, and learn in the process. Blogging requires me to clarify my thoughts, communicate them effectively to the reader, and help me reflect on them in the future. Additionally, it pushes me to delve into a topic, research it thoroughly, and write about it with a better understanding.

### 2. Being able to express myself better
In addition to improving my thinking and learning skills, I also aim to improve my self-expression through this blog. Expressing thoughts in written form can be challenging, but clear and effective communication is crucial in today's world. As an introvert, I often find it difficult to speak up or share my thoughts and ideas in social settings. However, I have a wealth of unique and creative ideas that I believe could resonate with someone out there. Perhaps, one day, we'll even have the opportunity to meet in person. I hope that this blog serves as an outlet for my imagination to run wild and for my ideas to flourish.

### 3. Document my journey
Another motivation behind starting this blog is to keep a record of my journey and current thoughts for future reflection. By documenting my progress and growth, I can look back and see just how far I've come. Additionally, if my experiences and reflections can offer help or bring happiness to someone else, it would be an added bonus and a fulfilling experience.

## GOALS
My objective for this blog is to publish a weekly article. Initially, I won't be prioritizing metrics or revenue generation. Instead, I want to concentrate on writing about subjects that I find interesting and fulfilling, which I believe will foster my commitment and sustain my engagement in the long run.
