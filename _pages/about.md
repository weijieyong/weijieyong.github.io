Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm WJ, a Robotics Engineer hailing from the charming town of Penang in Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾. My passion for engineering and robotics is what led me to pursue this career and build innovative and practical solutions to real-world problems.

Aside from my professional pursuits, I have a plethora of interests and hobbies that keep me grounded and entertained. I love to explore new places, document my experiences through photography and videography, and indulge in good food, often trying out new recipes and cuisines. 
In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano as a form of stress relief and have a persistent thirst for knowledge, constantly seeking to expand my skills and understanding through new experiences.

Overall, I strive to lead a balanced life, merging my passion for engineering and creativity, and continuously seeking new challenges and experiences. Through my blog, I hope to share my insights and adventures with you, and hopefully, inspire you to live life to the fullest.
